          I grew up in Saugerties, NY. I discovered my desire to study
          Computer Science in my high school's AP CS Principles course. 
          My teacher made the subject fun to learn, and I felt it was something
          my brain could get a handle on easily.<br><br>

          Despite my interest in the major I chose, I'm not sure where I want 
          to take it, and I'm not sure where I see myself after graduating. My main 
          hope is to find a career with a sustainable work-life balance, leaving some
          room for myself and my hobbies.<br><br>

          One of the biggest asperations I have for my life outside of a career is to try to make a video game.
          I'd like to create something that others can enjoy, the same way I've enjoyed the games that passionate
          artists have put out over the years.
