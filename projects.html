          <hr>
          <p>
            Light's Path is a video game demo made in the Godot application. The player 
            moves around a beam of light using the mouse pointer.
            Using the physical player character, they can redirect the path of 
            the beam by walking into and turning mirrors from a handle on the back.
          </p>
          <p> 
            A level is completed when the player successfully redirects the light
            to hit the large crystal, thus opening the door to process to the next
            level.

          <h2 class="project-heading">Various Ceramics Pieces</h3>
          <hr>
          <p>
            I've made a variety of ceramic works over the years. These works range from
            simple pinch pots to things like slab butter dishes, wheel thrown pottery, sculpture work, 
            and a large hand-built vase.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pieces use either earthenware or stoneware clay as well as a variety of glaze types: 
            underglaze, commercially manufactured, or glazes that were made on campus in the ceramics 
            studio.

          <h2 class="project-heading">Plethora of Pets</h3>
          <hr>
          <p>
            I've had a variety of pets over the course of my life. In total, I've had 
            one dog, 2 hamsters, 12 birds (2 cockatiels, 10 budgies), 
            a handful of fish, and a small frog. We briefly watched over my sisters two snakes, as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            We've had the most birds out of everything, since two of our previous budgies had 5 babies, giving us a grand
            total of 9 birds at the same time.
            Right now, however, we only have two budgies: Pickle and Pepper.

          <hr>
          <p>
            A project I've had in mind for a while, after making the afformentioned game demo, was
            to try to make a fully-fleshed out game in my spare time. I want to work with one of my friends
            to adapt a D&D campaign I am a part of into a story-based game, with maybe a little combat. The game engine 
            I will use is still undecided.
          </p>
          <p>
            The game would take place in a small town called Snowfall, following four individuals in their
            misadventures navigating through a zombie apocalyse, while also discovering secrets about
            the town itself.
